  			<p>
  				Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the website.My name is Pariyar Anjali, and I'm thrilled to connect with all of you here. I'm a passionate and curious individual with a zest for life. I believe in continuous learning and growth, both personally and intellectually. With each day that passes, I strive to become a better version of myself.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				I hail from the beautiful country of Nepal.Living in Nepal has exposed me to a rich tapestry of culture, traditions, and diverse perspectives, which I greatly value and cherish. Currently I am living in Kyoto, japan and pursuing my master degree in computer science.
  			</p>
  			<p>
  				When I'm not engrossed in my studies, I can often find me pursuing various hobbies that bring joy to my life. One of my all-time favorite pastimes is singing.
  				Singing allows me to release my emotions and connect with my innermost feelings. Whether I am feeling joyful, sad, or contemplative, music provides the perfect canvas for me to express these emotions in a way that words alone cannot.
  			</p>
